## My modified version of the osu!lazer flatpak
Changes:
- Launch with Wayland by default (with fallback to x11)
- Launch with LatencyFleX for lower mouse latency
- Improved audio latency under pipewire (only works with Default/ALSA and JACK audio output)
- Launch with libstrangle to fix issue where the vulkan renderer does not disable vsync (important for wayland)
Notes:
- To make full use of this, make sure to use the Vulkan Renderer
- Running under Wayland with fractional scaling causes osu! to incorrectly detect the resolution. Manually change it in the settings.
- The files from the appimage are completely unmodified, changes are only made in the launch script

# osu!
Keep in mind that the package is **not** official, there may be bugs specific to the flatpak. If you find such, report them here.
> Note: This is osu!(lazer) - a future update which is yet to be considered mainstream. It is not osu!(stable).

## Where is the game directory located?
Check `~/.var/app/sh.ppy.osu/data/osu`

## Graphics tablets
osu! uses [OpenTabletDriver](https://github.com/OpenTabletDriver/OpenTabletDriver) for graphics tablets support. \
However, it may not work for some reasons, here are some of them:
 - **At the moment, the tablet is controlled by the kernel module** \
You need to unload the module yourself from the terminal, using the following command: \
`sudo rmmod wacom || sudo rmmod hid_uclogic`
 - **Failed to open device streams** \
You need to download and execute the script from this repository (`tablet-udev-gen-rules.sh`) and create some [udev rules](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/udev)\
Don't forget to install `git` and `jq` via your package manager! \
\
If you are *not sure*/*do not understand* what to do:
```
curl -L -o ./tablet-udev-gen-rules.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flathub/sh.ppy.osu/master/tablet-udev-gen-rules.sh
chmod +x ./tablet-udev-gen-rules.sh
./tablet-udev-gen-rules.sh --idk # press Enter after udev question
```
or, follow [this guide](https://opentabletdriver.net/Wiki/FAQ/Linux#fail-device-streams)
> **_Note_**: To generate udev rules using the official guide, you need to install `dotnet` from the repositories of your distribution

Please, share your experience of using a graphics tablet in **osu!**. Both on the build in `flatpak` and on the official one (`AppImage`).

## When selecting files, not all directories are visible
This happens because when a flatpak container is launched, only the necessary directories are passed through to it.

If you want to be able to access all files and directories in your home directory, use `Flatseal` from `flatpak`, or `sudo flatpak override sh.ppy.osu --filesystem=home`
